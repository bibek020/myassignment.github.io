    <h3 class="text-center">Chicken</h3>
    <p>
    A farmed fowl, the chicken is a subspecies of the red junglefowl. Chickens are the most prevalent and widely distributed domestic animals, with a population of more than 19 billion in 2011. They outnumber any other bird or domestic animal on the planet.
    </p>
   
    <h4>Terms</h4>
    <p>
    Older male chickens above the age of one year are typically referred to as cocks in the United Kingdom and Ireland, but roosters in the United States, Australia, and Canada. Cockerels are males younger than a year. Capons are castrated roosters (surgical and chemical castration are now illegal in some parts of the world). In the egg-laying industry, a pullet becomes a hen once she begins to produce eggs at the age of 16 to 20 weeks.
    </p>
    
    <h4>The study of life</h4>
    <p>
    A bigger comb distinguishes the adult rooster from the hen in some breeds.
    Chickens are omnivores, which means they eat a wide variety of foods. They scratch at the ground in the wild to look for seeds, insects, and even larger animals like lizards, small snakes, and baby mice.
